# Time-Series-Momentum
Time series momentum is a trading strategy that involves taking positions based on the observed momentum in the price movement of a financial asset over time.

The concept behind time series momentum is that asset prices tend to exhibit persistence in their movements, meaning that if a price has been increasing (or decreasing) over a certain period, it is more likely to continue in that direction for a period of time. 

This momentum effect is based on the belief that market trends can persist and that past price movements can provide valuable information for predicting future price movements.
